# Recipe Discovery Platform Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Recipe Discovery Platform coding challenge! This task is designed to assess your skills in designing and implementing a backend API using both REST and GraphQL paradigms with the HotChocolate framework in .NET. We’re excited to see your creativity and technical expertise in action!

## Overview

You’ll build a backend for a **Recipe Discovery Platform** where users can browse recipes, filter them by criteria like cuisine or ingredients, and save their favorites. The application should expose both a REST API and a GraphQL API, with an optional bonus challenge to use GraphQL as an orchestration layer over a public REST API.

### Objectives
- Demonstrate proficiency in .NET and the HotChocolate framework.
- Design clean, maintainable APIs using REST and GraphQL.
- Optionally integrate a public API or mock data to power the application.
- Bonus: Use GraphQL to orchestrate and enrich data from a REST API.
